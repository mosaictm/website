all links need smooth snap scrolling(the quick links and the logo link dont have it)

add links for social media

fix جميع المشاريع button(a pop up window that has all the projects on slideshow or delete the whole button maybe)

fix the slideshow in the projects pop up(only the first photo shows), there maybe is a fixed number of photos which gives a fixed number of placeholders in the slideshow

the تواصل معنا  button that is in the خدماتنا section doesnt do a thing

two تواصل معنا  buttons one in the hero and one in the nav bar which gives bad ux design

the شهادات العملاء button needs to be replaced

the اكتشف المزيد  button in  خدماتنا needs to be addressed

the تعرف علينا button in the hero section and the تعرف على فريقنا in the من نحن  section need functionality

should add actual terms and services to the footer

should add actual projects in the mobile apps section

must host the projects on vercel             or you go to jail

the address should be changed to درعا/دمشق since we want local attention at first

the blog section should be redone

should add more projects (3 of every kind seems perfect)
